# finalProjectCSCI343
This is our final project for CSCI343: Graphics with WebGL and Javascript

Christina and I have made a virtual aquarium where the user can move around freely and look at the fish swimming 
inside the environment.  We used perspective projection to make it appear as if the fish have depth to them.  
The environment is randomized, so no two scenes will show up in succession.  We used random numbers to generate 
the depth position, the X and Y positions, and the speed of the fish.
